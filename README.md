# basicGraphGenerator

A basic app to create graphs.

It can create graphs with data given by the user or with the data that is pulled from twelvedata.com.

To make it easier to use,  I added a simple text editor that can be accessed by (menu -> edit -> open the text editor)

There are three ways to display the data that is collected:
  -lines
  -bars
  -dots
those can be chosen by (menu -> view)
