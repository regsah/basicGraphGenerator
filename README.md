# basicGraphGenerator

A basic app to create graphs.

It can create graphs with data given by the user or with the data that is pulled from twelvedata.com.

To pull data you have to enter the nasdaq code of the company that you want to view (MSFT for Microsoft, TSLA for Tesla etc.)

To make it easier to use,  I added a simple text editor that can be accessed by following (menu -> edit -> open the text editor)

It is possible to display the data in three ways (lines, bars and dots) which can be chosen by following (menu -> view)
